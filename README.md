1.) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I will ask a user precisely what they want a program to do.  When necessary I will ask for more information to better understand what they want from the program.  Creating a user story will allow anyone to read and understand what the user wants from a program.  The stories are written in plain english, so they can be easily understood by anyone.

2.) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach with developing programs is to start simple and iterate further from there.  I think it is best to work this way, because I like having a working program as early as possible.  It allows for testing of the program, and it also gives me an idea of how the program "feels."  An agile process I hope to incorporate is adaptability to change.  What this means to me is to be open to other possible solutions to a problem.  It also means that a change in direction from the customer will not frustrate me and slow my development progress.

3.) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is committed to the ultimate goal: satisfying user needs.  They are also willing to accept and give constructive criticism, and they are accountable to themselves and the team for the work that they produce.  Also, they are willing to help others on the team just as much as they are willing to ask for help.
